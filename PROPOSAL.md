# Linked Data tutorial proposal for the XML Summer School
In order to introduce the The idea is to create a personal knowledge graph as a learning as a way of learning about linked data. When creating a PKG, the first thing you would need to do is create a URI for yourself. So we would need to learn about Uris and URLs and how to structure them and how to make them unique. Once we have a URI for ourselves then we can think about what we want to have in our personal knowledge graph so that could be. We want to talk about our family or our holidays or the films we love or some sports that we are fanatical about and the matches that we watch or games so we decide the topic. Maybe it's all of these things eventually, so we now need to think about vocabularies. That will help us to talk about these things so that we can make connections. And then we want to think about the things that we want to talk about and the things that we want to connect to. We want to see if there are existing Uris that we can use for these things that we can connect to on the web of link, data or weather. There are things that we need to create for ourselves, whether they be quite personal things like our friends, family members, or perhaps things that are well known, but not well known enough for places like Wikipedia and we might want to create some new shared resources using something like wikidata. So at the end of the first part of the course they would have created a small personal knowledge graph. The second part of the course we would examine how we might make use of that knowledge graph. So to start with we would put the data into a triple store and learn to query it using sparkle we could also talk about how we might use our personal knowledge graph in other ways, such as in writing blogs or journals, creating websites, or sharing data with friends and family and platforms that are available for doing that such as solid.

From data to knowledge.
  Representing knowledge with graphs and triples
    Subject -> Predicate -> Object ; nodes and edges

  Identifying things with URIs
    Creating cool URIs for stuff
    URIs vs URLs
  Representing graphs and triples with RDF
    RDF syntax (mainly Turtle)
    Using RDFS vocabularies and OWL ontologies
    Finding and using existing vocabularies vs creating your own
  Knowledge Graphs
    Describing real world things and their relationships
    Implicit vs Explicit knowledge
  The Semantic Web
    Standardised Knowledge representations
    The Semantic web technology stack
  Linked Data /The Web of Data
    HTTP + URIs + RDF
    A web of human readable documents combined with machine readable data
    Finding stuff on the Web of Data
    Adding stuff to the web of data



Creating a Knowledge Graph

  Describing and linking things together with vocabularies
  when to re-use and when to define your own terms
  Finding things to link to in the Web of Data
  looking at DBpedia, Wikidata etc.
